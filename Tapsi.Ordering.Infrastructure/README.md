the Infrastructure layer contains implention of interfaces that Application layer needed it. Database repositories and other external services implemented in Infrastructure.


<b>Dependency Inversion in SOLID Principles</b>

In the SOLID principles, Dependency Inversion (DI) is a technique used to reduce the coupling between components of an application by injecting dependencies rather than having components create them internally. This ensures that classes do not need to know how to create the objects they depend on, making them more flexible, reusable, and easier to test.

DI is particularly important in adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), one of the key SOLID principles, which states that high-level modules (such as Application layer) should not depend on low-level modules (such as Infrastructure layer). Instead, both should depend on abstractions (interfaces). The application layer is responsible for defining these interfaces, while the infrastructure layer implements them.

In this architecture:

Application Layer: This layer defines the interfaces that describe the behavior required by the system. It focuses on the application's business logic and abstractly represents the services the system requires. This layer does not know how these services are implemented, which ensures that it remains independent of the specific implementations.

Infrastructure Layer: This layer provides the concrete implementations of the interfaces defined in the Application layer. It is where the actual logic of the system is executed, such as database access, external APIs, or file storage. The key here is that the Infrastructure layer’s responsibility is to fulfill the contracts set by the Application layer without the Application layer needing to know the details.

Through DI, you ensure that the Application layer can use the services from the Infrastructure layer without directly creating instances, thus maintaining flexibility and making it easier to swap out implementations when needed (for example, switching from one database to another).

By adhering to these principles, you achieve a highly decoupled, testable, and maintainable system.


<b>What is the "ServiceImpl" directory?</b>


The "ServiceImpl" directory contains the implementation of non-standard functions for services that require additional, customized logic. For example, in the case of the "SMSService" in the Service Directory, it implements the "ISMSService" interface from the application layer. Since SMS sending requires various providers and methods that may not be standard, the ServiceImpl directory is where these non-standard functions are implemented.

In this approach:

"SMSService" has an object of "ISMSImpl".<br>
"SMSIRMethods" implements the "ISMSImpl" interface.


This design ensures that we adhere to the Open/Closed and Dependency Inversion (DI) principles, while the additional, custom logic is contained within the ServiceImpl directory, keeping the main service logic clean and modular.
